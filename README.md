# Software Architecture, Process, and Management

This repository contains my coursework for the 5th Year [Software Archtiecture, Process, and Management](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/sapm/) course, taken in 2012/2013. There was only one piece of coursework for the SAPM course; an unrestricted essay making and defending any hypothesis that related to Software Engineering. My chosen hypothesis was: 'Agile methodologies are suitable and beneficial for large scale, safety-critical systems, with a standard amount of modification.'

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
